The code is fairly straightforward to use. Iâ€™m not sure what your familiarity with Python is, but I had quite little experience when I wrote/modified the code. If you're on a Mac, you'll want to install Python3 prior to attempting to use it -- Mac computers come with Python2 preinstalled but the script is written in 3 so obviously that won't work. If you're using Windows, I think you'll have to install Python3 (no preinstalled Python). 

Then, before you run the script, you'll have to add the appropriate API keys to the appropriate positions in the code (described more in-depth there).

Once you have that done, open the queue.txt file and add the list of users you want to download. 

Then open a terminal window, enter "python3 " (with the space), drag in the script, and hit enter. It should work as intended.
